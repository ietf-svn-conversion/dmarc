# README for dmarc-draftissues

Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) is an 
email authentication protocol first published as an RFC with Informational status
in RFC 7489 - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7489

A working group to update this specification was chartered by the IETF; the working 
group's charter is here - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-dmarc/

This is the github repository for issues that were opened in Datatracker for that
work prior to Datatracker being replaced by GitHub for the purpose of tracking 
issues.
